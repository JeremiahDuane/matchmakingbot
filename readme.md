## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Only `python-dotenv` is needed:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

If pip is unavailable, you can use the lightweight `dotenv.py` alternative included.

---

### 2. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:

```
EMAIL_ADDRESS=christianmatchmakingbot@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
DATA_DIR=data/<current-form-identifier-here>
```

## 🚀 Running the Pipeline

### Phase 1 – Match Calculation

```bash
python phase1.py
```

Generates `phase1_matches.json` from `users.json` based on mutual preferences.

---

### Phase 2 – Email Match Results (Round 1)

```bash
python phase2.py
# !! You should probably test before running any send scripts !!
python phase2_send.py
```

Sends emails using match results from Phase 1.

---

### Phase 3 – Mutual Interest Submissions

```bash
python phase3.py
# !! You should probably test before running any send scripts !!
python phase3_send.py
```

Generates mutual matches based on submitted interest (`submissions.json`) and sends contact emails directly.

---

### Test Mode

Run test email previews:

```bash
python test1.py
python test1_send.py
python test2.py
python test2_send.py
```

The test scripts render 2 random results for human verification. Run this as many times as you want. 

The `send` test scripts send at most only 10 sample emails to the bot email address for safe testing.
